= Building BugEngine =
======================


Supported platforms
----------------------

The following platforms are currently tested and known to build & work :
- win32 with GCC 4.3/4.4/4.5
- win32 with visual studio 2005/2008/2010/express editions
- win32 with command line MSVC compiler (eg Windows SDK) up till Visual Studio 2010

- linux amd64 with GCC 4.1 to 4.6
- linux powerpc (G5) with GCC 4.1 to 4.6
- linux x86/amd64 with sunCC

- MacOS X 10.4 to 10.6 (ppc and x86) with GCC 4.0 or 4.2

- OpenSolaris/Solaris 10 with GCC
- OpenSolaris/Solaris 10 with SunCC
- FreeBSD with GCC



Building
-----------

The requirements for building BugEngine are quite low:
You need one of the supported compilers installed and working
You need python installed (tested with python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 3.1)
You need Flex and Bison (for windows they are included)

waf is the build system that is used for building.
waf can also be used to generate projects for MSVC 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010 including express versions, and XCode


Configuring
..............

In the root folder of the project, run
> python waf configure
it will detect all the supported toolchains and try and pick the most appropriated one
(it doesn't always pick the best one)
The last line in the output sums up which version and compiler was picked.
You can choose manually from the available toolchains with the --toolchains option.
The format of the toolchain is variant-compiler-platform-architecture-version
where variant is one of the build variants in debug, profile, final
compiler is the name of the compiler in msvc, wsdk (windows sdk), gcc, icc, opencc, suncc...
platform is the name of the platform in linux, win32, freebsd, osx, sunos...
architecture is the name of the CPU architecture in x86, amd64, x64 (alias for amd64), ppc, ppc64, arm...
version is the version of the compiler, it depends on the compiler
it can be 4.1 or 4.4.1 for GCC, 8.0 or 9.0 for MSVC, the version of the windows SDK for the command line, etc

The argument expected by the --toolchains parameter is a list of regular expressions :
> python waf configure --toolchains=.*-gcc-.*
will select all toolchains with GCC (which can be a lot of several versions of GCC are installed)
> python waf configure --toolchains=debug-msvc-win32-.*-10.0, debug-gcc-win32-x86-4.4
will pick all compilers available for visual studio 2010 (probably x86 and amd64) and GCC 4.4


Discovering
..............

The project trys to automatically find the compilers and you usually don't need to
specify a path or anything. This is more comfortable on Win32 where you
don't need to set the MSVC environment for the project to build.
Waf will automatically detect which compilers are installed and configure them properly,
even if visual studio was not installed in the default path.


Building from the command line
.................................

when you have decided which compiler to use, you can build & "install" by running
> python waf install
It should build all source files, compile all libs and a sample executable
and move them to a folder specific to the toolchain


Bulding with IDEs
....................

The other way of building is to create projects for the supported IDEs and build from the IDE
the supported IDEs at the moment are Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010, in their complete or
express editions.
To generate the project files, configure the project (which toolchain is selected doesn't
actually matter) and run
> python waf install --projects=[ide list]
where [ide-list] is the list of projects you'd like to generate in
vs2005, vs2008, vs2010, vs2005e or vs2008e, or xcode3, xcode4
> python waf install --projects=vs2005e,vs2010
will create a set of projects and a solution for Visual Studio 2005 express, and another set of
projects and solutions for Visual Studio 2010.
You don't need to have these installed to generate the projects, you just need them to actually
open the projects.



Project architecture
=======================

Engine
---------

The project contains only two folders at its root; under mak/ are all the python scripts and
tools that are used to build the project, and under src/ are all the sources.
src/ contains several folders that are used to sort the subprojects. The categories are
 3rdparty/ : external libraries (sometimes with sources, sometimes just a set of compile flags or libs)
 engine/ : the main engine source files
 plugin/ : plugins that are built separately from the engine
 game/ : the game projects that use the engine

Each folder can contain several subprojects. The main folder, engine/, contains a lot of different
subprojects that can depend on each other. Each project has 3 kind of files : sources under the src/
folder, private headers in the incude/ folder and public headers in the api/ folder.
The sources are discovered automatically; if a file has a known extension and is in the src/ folder,
then it will be built and/or added to the projects
Source files in include/ or api/ are never built.
Some folders have a special syntax to let the build system know that they are platform or architecture specific;
sources in the folder platforms=win32/ are built only when the target (and not the host) platform is win32.
sources in a folder archs=x86/ are only build for x86
sources in a folder archs=x86,amd64/ are built for these two architectures, but not for powerpc.
These sources are also excluded from the projects when it makes sense


Editor
---------

The editor is a plugin of the game; it is loaded automatically on startup, and will run with the game code embedded.


Static/dynamic builds
------------------------

The engine can be built either using shared versions of the engine or be statically linked to the engine.
Both architectures are supported and can be changed by editing the wscript file.
Shared versions build a little faster and are lighter than the static executables but harder to redistribute.
On some platforms, only static builds work (when plugins are not available)
